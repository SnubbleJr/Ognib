Ognib
=====
:D This is a community driven (English) bingo software designed for KritzKast, with rules taken from Terrzyl’s American bingo template

The game runs off 4 files, located in the Ognib/Build Folder:

Settings
Classes
Presenters
Rules

with these, you can edit the defualt settings, as dictated by the people, add new rules, clasess and even presenters!

Settings contain 3 items:

1. 9 - the number of coloumbs per row
2. 3 - the number of rows
3. 5 - the number of tiles that are filled in per row (NOTE: will defual to the number of coluombs if higher than the number of columbs)


The other 3 files consist of a special format:

` seperated values

the ` character is the character given if you hit the dev console button in TF2 (look for the ¬ key on UK keyboards, to left to the 1 key)

for example, this is the contents of Presenters.txt

General`NULL`KKast.png
Special Guest`NULL`KKast.png
Agro`Pyro`Agro.png
Chronos`Demoman`Chronos.jpg
RuskeyDoo`Heavy`Ruskey.jpg
Sir Grey`Spy`SirG.jpg
Tempest`Soldier`Tempest.jpg

here, the structure is, the presenter name, their class, and then the avatar image name located within the build folder

Classes.txt has a similar format, but with only 2 arguments per entry:
Spy`Spy_emblem_RED.png

NOTE: NULL is the default class here.

RULES! THE BIG ONE!

example rules in Rules.txt:

Sir Grey`Sir Grey's "dapper-ness" or photography mentioned
Tempest`Tempest appears
Agro`Agro Drinks vodka again
Special Guest`Special Guest appears!
General`Host question choice of drink other host brought

Here, it is simply, the Presenter assoicated with the rule, followed by the text, and that's it!

NOTE: GITHUB WILL PUT A EMPTY LINE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE, REMOVE THAT EMPTY LINE OR IT WILL BREAK!

Rememeber to use the ` key to sperate it! spaces around it is not needed, for adding classes, if you want to leave the picture null, just do ``

`

^There's the character so you can copy paste

Now go make me Proud!
